Want to write your own configuration? Here's how!

First, name the file how you would like it to appear in the list, and make sure the extension at the end is .json.
** Replace any spaces with underscores (_)
* You don't need any special software to edit a JSON file, but Notepad++ is recommended.

Next, here is what the Simple setting looks like:

The commas separating each item are important, and you'll notice lines without commas, too. If it doesn't have a comma, it's the end of the list or set.
Here's what each thing is doing:

"info": This fills the Info button's textbox. A \n is the only way to start a new line.
"globalTags": These are settings that affect the whole randomization and gameplay. We have "NO_DKEYS_LOGIC" here so that vanilla key placement later on doesn't jam the completion checker.
"initialItems": These will grant the player items to start with. We've selected "24Shards" and 3 "Secretkeys" so that all the Secret Dungeons can be opened and the completion checker will be able to access Tomb of Simulacrum after Passel.
"itemGroups": This is where randomly plucked item decks go. Let's dig into each one:
 - "groupName": The name of this group that you'll use in the item lists. Our first one is named "Outfit".
 - "items": The items contained in the group. We have the 7 Outfits here, and only one copy of each.
 - In the "EXTRA" group, we have lots of copies of items. This is because as each item is picked, it's removed from the list. This way, we can have multiple of an item as well as a max amount of each.
 - Also, take note that we have 4 "Outfit"s in the group. A group can reference another group, too.
"pools": These are your item lists that will get placed into the game. You can decide where with sets of tags.
 - "name": The name of your item pool. Only used in the output log. Our first is named "Vanilla Items".
 - "tags": Which items will be populated by this list. In "Vanilla Items", we use the tag "VANILLA" to make sure the selected location sets don't have their items randomized.
 - "defaultItems": Put items here and they'll fill out any chest that didn't get filled by the item list below. We use this with an empty item list in "Cave Bonuses" to populate all the caves and portal worlds with the "EXTRA" group.
 - "allShuffles": Use "start" and "end" to select ranges in the item list that will get mixed around. Anything not shuffled will be placed in order. Index starts at 0.
 - "itemsList": The items to get placed into random locations, in the order listed, unless told to be shuffled.
 * Using "defaultItems" outside of "pools" will populate unused chests after all pools have finished
 * "allShuffles" allows you to section off certain sets of items until later or earlier, and also mix up which items will show up first. See the "Queen of Adventure" preset for a more complex use of it.
 * "allShuffles" start and end ranges can overlap if you so please, too, and there's no limit to how many you can have.

To ensure a seed can be completed, you will need to make sure an item that opens up a fair bit of locations is acquired before the game runs out of locations. In "Queen of Adventure", our first Shuffle only spans 4 items because there are only 4 locations available without any weapon. After that, with as many caves as there are, we can relax the item flow quite a bit. However, "Dungeon Diver" doesn't shuffle Caves, so it still needs to be careful about making sure useful keys and items are placed soon. At the end of "Dungeon Diver", the EFCS doors are opened, followed by the last Raft Piece, one of the unnecessary keys, and some bonus items. This will weight the last Raft Piece toward being near Simulacrum, or at least a fairly deep location.

In "Queen of Adventure", only 7 Raft Pieces are placed in the pool, and we use a pool that only includes Passel's room to place the EFCS 'key' on Passel and then another pool that deliberately places the last Raft Piece on the Big Old Pile of Loot in Simulacrum's room. Our item list also carefully only includes as many Lockpicks, Crayons, and even Cave Scrolls as was in the original game, though the Scrolls are replaced with Yellow Hearts. With this, we have the entire game mixed up without any extra items except the Roll and initial Stick, and the goal is to beat Simulacrum.

Randomization will always only fill up item locations it knows are currently available, so if it runs out of items to place or locations it can fill without completing the given locations, it will consider the seed a lost cause and try to pull a new one. If no seeds can resolve, you might need to add more items to your pool, or change when they're given to the player. Make sure the player has the necessary keys to traverse dungeons, too.

If you're really stumped, you can use the "randomizeitems" command in the debug menu, followed by the config filename, and a given 8-char seed. This will generate a detailed output log showing:
 - How many chests are available each time an item is placed
 - What item is being placed and where at each step of randomization
 - When the randomizer gets stuck
 - Invalid entries for tags or items
 - The outcome of randomization, even if it failed

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask our development discord.

See below for a list of valid items, keys, and tags


GLOSSARY

Global tags
- NO_LOGIC: The randomizer will place items without checking for conditions. Might result in an unwinnable randomization.
- GLITCHES_ALLOWED: Makes the randomizer take glitched movement into consideration for item placement.
- NO_STICK: The player starts unable to melee attack with the stick. Any stick related item (StickLvl, Stick, FireSword, FireMace and EFCS) will make the player able to attack again.
- NO_ROLL: The player starts unable to roll. "Roll" and "DefenseLvl" items will enable the player to roll again.
- NO_DEV_UPGRADES: Picking up the 4th force staff, ice ring or dynamite wont give the player the DEV version of that weapon. Useful for placing extra weapons pickups without risking giving the player overpowered items.
- NO_EFCS_UPGRADE: Picking up StickLvl while having a Fire Mace wont upgrade it to an EFCS. Useful for placing extra StickLvls pickups without giving the player a sequence-breaking weapon.
- REPLACE_EFCS_UPGRADE: Picking up StickLvl while having a Fire Mace will open all the EFCS-only gates and doors instead of giving the player an EFCS. Useful for replicating the entire stick progression without giving the player a sequence-breaking weapon.
- NO_DKEYS_LOGIC: Disable all checks for DKEY items. Use it only when giving the player all dungeon keys at the start or when the player has access to enough lockpicks for the entire game or when there is a pool tagged as "DUNGEON_KEYS" and "VANILLA".
- BYPASS_NO_CHESTS_ERROR: If a pool returns a "No more chests available" error, dont make the randomization fail. This will result in unreacheable empty items and items from the items list not randomized.
- BYPASS_DEFAULT_ITEM_ERROR: If a pool returns a "Chests with default or vanilla items left inaccesible" error, dont make the randomization fail. This will result in unreacheable empty items.
- OPEN_DREAM_WORLD: Allow the player to enter dream worlds with all their items.
- USE_MOD_SPAWNED: Allow the mod to spawn extra chests (it does nothing currently)

Pool tags:
Note: "Chests" refers to any important item placed inside a chest or placed on the ground.
- ALL: Select all chests.
- DREAM_WORLD: Select all chests in dream worlds.
- CARDS: Select all chests which originally contained cards.
- RAFT_PIECES: Select all chests which originally contained raft pieces.
- DUNGEON_KEYS: Select all chests which originally contained dungeon keys.
- CAVES: Select all chests in caves.
- DUNGEONS: Select all chests in dungeons.
- PORTAL_WORLDS: Select all chests in portal worlds.
- SECRET_DUNGEONS: Select all chests in secret dungeons.
- BOSS: Select all chests tagged as "boss reward".
- ITEM_<name>: Select all chests which originally contained <name> item.
- SCENE_<name>: Select all chests in the <name> scene.
- CHESTID_<number>: Select the chest with the Chest ID <number>.
- VANILLA: Mark the pool to be filled with its vanilla item. IMPORTANT: The item list of the pool should be empty or the randomizer will throw a "No more chests available" error.
- NO_LOGIC: The randomizer will place items without checking for conditions in this pool. Since this affects the simulation of other pools, it is highly recommended to use it only with items that doesnt affect the simulation progress.
