__Extra 2 Dew v2.0__

We've spent months making this major update. The majority of the mod can now be used with easy to use UI elements! No more having to type complicated commands! (though you still can if you wish)
The UI includes custom icons, buttons, and menus. You can even enable the various game modes from a menu when creating a new file! Nifty!
This update also brings many bug fixes!

New Game Modes:
• Entrance randomizer: Randomizes each entrance. Randomization is based on logic, so the game will always be beatable no matter how the entrances are sorted out!
• Boss Rush: A gauntlet of one boss after another! Does not include minibosses. Option to heal between each fight for whimps. Does not include minibosses or puzzle "bosses"
• Dungeon rush: Speed through every dungeon in order, including ||Promised Remedy||. Includes boss fights!

New Features:
• User friendly interface! An entire menu has been made for the mod. You no longer need to type complicated commands, you just click a few buttons, move a few sliders, and your dreams come true! Nearly all of the debug console functionality has been put into this UI, so major shoutouts to Matra for this!
• Speedrun anticheat is now a thing! As of this version, the mod can be installed during speedruns, as long as you toggle the "speedrun" checkbox when making a new file. This disables all command key binds and resets all commands that would normally persist through main menu.
• Per-file settings are now universal. So if you disable cutscenes in 1 file, they're disabled across all files, even new ones you make!
• [Debug command] `weather`: Sets the current weather. Don't let that mild volcanic eruption stop your adventure! Available weather effects are: `eruption`, `snow`, `rain`, `sun` (increases lightning chance), and `nightcave` (spawns Monochromes from caves at random). Works indoors too and can combine weather effects!
• [Debug command] `status`: Applies the chosen status to Ittle or any enemy! Can even use scrapped status effects!
• [Debug command] `progress`: Was completely redone so it now works for any save file, even ones made before the mod was installed! It breaks down progress by caves completed, chests opened, dungeons completed, and cards collected. It even shows per-file progress on file select!

Bug Fixes:
• Saving and loading positions not working in Remedy
• Commands used stat resetting on game quits
• Giving yourself items in Dream World maps or Bad Dream being overwritten by the varOverrider
• Knockback not resetting to default after save & quit
• Pause menu warping not healing you if warping to another scene
• Some loading zones getting disabled after certain custom event method calls
• Pathfinding enemies despawning in first person or free cam modes
• LikeABoss not killing normally invincible enemies (eg. steels)
• Position loading not working in Art Exhibit
• Using `goto` to go to a cave scene, then dying in said cave not respawning correctly

Improvements:
• [Debug console] Many commands have help dialogue if you just type the command name. Gives same info that can be found for the command on the GitHub
• [Stability] Changed how ModSaver handled commiting save file changes, so it shouldn't cause any issues down the road, and is more performant

__Extra 2 Dew v2.0-1.1b__
